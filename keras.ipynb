    "After these pre-selected images are seggregated, the images need to resized to specific size only. Images are represented as arrays in machine learning, therefore, to model all the arrays needs to be of same size. On google, you may find images with various pixel dimensions like (1024, 780) (800, 600). These sizes need to be reduced to (50, 50) or (80, 80). Smaller the size, less computational resources will be required however, it may result in lesser accurate model"
